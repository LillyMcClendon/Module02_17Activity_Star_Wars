### All points changed from blue to pink

```{r starwars-plot}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender, size = birth_year)) +
  geom_point(color = "pink") +
  labs(size = "Birth year", x = "Height", y = "Mass")
```

### Stretch goal: Add labels for title, x and y axes, and size of points.
